### What we're about

Hi everyone,

*Why this group?*

As we know, deep learning has taken over as the predominent machine learning tool to solve real world problems with accuracies never witnessed before. Personally, I am always fascinated by this feat, as I was part of the era where neural networks were dead animals and also lucky to the see the rise of them as they go 'deeper' - thanks to the increased parallel computation power, massive data, and active role of tech giants like Google and Microsoft.

I personally feel this is the time, we actively persue to bring neural netwroks to *bring out our creativities*. Several folks around the world have started it, check out cool projects like:

• https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/ ,

• https://magenta.tensorflow.org/

• https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/

I am very excited about the future where we can use neural networks to achieve the peak of creativity. Imagine a world, where we can go beyond the limitation of time and limited human cognitive capacity using these tools, and create masterpieces in music or arts or movie that allows us to express our creativity.

I believe, the time is now. Let's start a conversation, right here in Toronto.

The group will NOT be limited to deep learning researchers, but will be open to creative artists, or anyone who want to explore how to create artisitic contents using deep learning tools.

This is an experimental group, and I am always open to your suggestions!

*Briefly about myself*

It's Debanga. I'm a computer vision researcher and a Toronto-based entrepreneur.

I have travelled a lot across the world in the last few years for reasearch and work. Travelling and entrepreneuship have changed the way I look at the people and the world. I have come far from the days when I used to stay inside the dorm room coding day and night, to understanding how important the communication among fellow people outside your domain of work is - both for a more accepting mindset and to increase our happiness. It provided me with an opportunity to learn more about others.

Verbal communication is not the only way of effective communication, we can express our emotions and passions though a piece of music, a painting, or even through a cool html5 website you just designed. But, we are limited by time - both in terms of learning and creating. This group is my attempt to start a conversation around how we can use latest deep learning tools to make our passions come to life with the limited resources we have.
